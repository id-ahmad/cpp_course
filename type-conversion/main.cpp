/*
Conversion : producing a new value of some type from another value of a diff type (The original value is not changed, neither its type)
Implicit conversion(automatic/coercion) : done automatically by the compiler.
The rules that define how types can be converted in C++ are called standard conversions.
Standard conv categories :
    Numeric promotion
    Nimeric conversions
    Arithmetic converions
    Other convs
*/

/*
Numeric promotion : conversion of certain narrrower types (e.g. char) to a certain wider type (typically int or double) that can be processed efficiently.
Numeric promotions are value-preserving, which makes them safe conversions.
Numeric promotion categories: Integral (conv to int), floating point (conv to double)
*/

/*
Numeric conversions cover additional type conversions between fundamental types.
Numeric conversions categories :
    Value-preserving convs (safe)
    Reinterpretive convs (representation in memory is same, just reinterpreted. therefore, value can be converted back) (potentially unsafe)
    Lossy convs (value can NOT be converted back) (unsafe)

*/

/*
Narrowing conversions is potentially unsafe conv wherethe distination type may not be able to hold all values of the source type.
Narrowing conversions usually generate compiler errors.
Good practice : use explicit converions (casting) when dealing with narrowing conv (no warnings + clear intentions).
Brace initalization disallows narrowing conv. A good reason to prefer brace init.
Some narrowing conversions are not considered as so if the source value is a constexpr (bcz the compiler makes sure it's safe). This allows to avoid
using literal suffixes in most cases, and to clutter our inits with static_cast. This is allowed as long as the value is in range of the destination type
, even if the destination type doesnâ€™t have enough precision to precisely store the value!
*/

/*
In C++, some operators require the operands to be of the same type. If unmaching types, an implicit conv may have place.
There's a priority list from types to know which one to convert. Lower priority type is always the one converted. If both types of operands aren't in the list,
they're both numerically promoted.
Bcz of this priority, mixing signed and unsigned can cause many issues (risk of unexpected results).
*/

/*
Casting is explicit type conversion.
C++ supports 5 different types of casts: C-style casts, static casts, const casts, dynamic casts, and reinterpret casts
Const casts and reinterpret casts should generally be avoided.
C-style casts may perform diff types of casting depending on the context (static, reinterpret..), which makes them less predictible and increase the risk of being inadvertly misused.
C-style casts should be avoided.
static cast is a type of casting in C++ (should be favored).
static cast provides compile time type checking.
static cast can be used for explicit narrowing conversions (intentions are clear).
*/

/*
type alias : another identifier to use whenever the aliased type can be used (it's not a new type, just a reference to an existant one).
Naming pratice : start with capital later with no suffixes.
alias identifies follow scope rules of var identifiers(global/block scope)
typedef is an old way for creating aliases( only used for backward compat.).
type aliases shoulf be FAVORED.
type aliases can be used for crossplatform coding, to simplify complex types, to document a value (e.g. a return type meaning) or simplify code maintenance.
Type aliases can affect badly code quality if not jusdiciously used. There should be a CLEAR benefit to code readability or code maintenance.
*/

/*
Type deduction (or inference) : used to deduce the type of an obj from its initializer, therefore providing one is mandatory.
auto keywork is uded for type deduction.
auto drops cont constexpr (should be added if wanted)
auto can help to avoid uintentional uninitialized vars.
auto avoids implicit conversions.
auto downsides : real type hidden
In general, type deduction is good to use with vars.
auto can be used for funct return (C++14).
funcs with auto return type can NOT be forward declared (the compiler should see the whole def).
Favor explicit return type for functions.
In C++20, auto can be used with func parameters. The feature trigged is no longer type deduction, but fuction templates.It's an extension of the usage of auto keyword.
